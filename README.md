### Objectives
To explore patterns in employee turnover, calculate attrition rates by role,Gender,Age Group,Department,Work-life balance,Years at comapany,Monthly income and provide actionable insights using data visualization.


### Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, publicly available on Kaggle:

üîó IBM HR Analytics Dataset on Kaggle

**Format**: CSV

**Rows**: 1,470 employees

**Columns**: 35 features including Age, Job Role, Department, Monthly Income, Years at Company, and Attrition status


### Tools 
- Power BI  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- Microsoft Excel (Data cleaning)


### Data Cleaning
- Removed Duplicates
- Renamed columns
- Data Type Formatting
- Created Conditional Columns
- Filtered Irrelevant Columns
- Reordered columns
- Replaced Values in columns


### Data Exploratory Analysis
- Analyze patterns and trends driving employee attrition across the organization
- Identify high-risk employee groups by department, age, gender, and job role
- Assess the impact of work-life balance on attrition rates
- Highlight roles with the highest and lowest turnover for targeted intervention


### Data Analysis
- Used Data Analysis Expression to create measures and new columns.
```Attrition Rate = DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'),'WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[Attrition]="Yes"),COUNTROWS('WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'))
Average Income = AVERAGE('WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[MonthlyIncome])
Average Years = AVERAGE('WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[YearsAtCompany])
Employee who left = CALCULATE([Total Employees],'WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[Attrition]="Yes" )
human resources rate = CALCULATE([Attrition Rate (%)],'WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[JobRole]="Human Resources")
laboratorytech attrition rate = CALCULATE([Attrition Rate (%)],'WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[JobRole]="Laboratory Technician")
Salesrep attrition rate = CALCULATE([Attrition Rate (%)],'WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[JobRole]="Sales Representative")
Total Employees = COUNT('WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[Age])
Attrition Rate (%) = DIVIDE([Employee who left],[Total Employees])
Age Bracket = 
IF('WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[Age]>=51,"51-60",
IF('WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[Age]>=41,"41-50",
IF('WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[Age]>=31,"31-40",
IF('WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[Age]>=21,"21-30",
"18-20"))))
```


### Core Insights
- Overall attrition rate is 16.1%, with significant variation across departments and roles.
- Male employees have a higher attrition rate (17%) compared to females (14.8%).
- Sales department records the highest attrition rate (20.6%), while Human Resources has the lowest (0.8%).
- Young employees (18‚Äì30) are most likely to leave, with 57% attrition in the 18‚Äì20 age group.
- Employees reporting a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù work-life balance paradoxically show the highest attrition.
- Sales representatives and lab technicians are the most turnover-prone roles, with 39.8% and 23.9% attrition respectively.
- Research & Development has the highest number of exits, due to its size, despite a moderate attrition rate.
- Older employees (41‚Äì60) have the lowest attrition rates, indicating stronger retention in experienced workforce segments.


### Recommendations
***Targeted Retention Strategies***
- Focus on Sales Representatives, Laboratory Technicians, and HR Professionals‚Äîthe top 3 roles with the highest attrition rates.

***Employee Engagement Programs***
- Introduce mentorship, flexible work options, and career development programs in high-risk departments.

**Review Compensation and Workload**
- Evaluate whether workload, salary satisfaction, or lack of growth opportunities are contributing to attrition in specific roles.

**Conduct Exit Interviews**
- Implement structured exit interviews to gather insights on reasons for leaving, especially in high-turnover roles.

**Data-Driven Monitoring**
- Use dashboards like this to regularly track attrition, tenure, and job satisfaction, enabling proactive HR intervention.


  ### Limitations
- The dataset is synthetic and may not reflect real-world HR dynamics.
- No time-based data‚Äîunable to track attrition trends over time.
- Limited context (e.g., no data on employee location or exit reasons).
- Attrition is binary (Yes/No), restricting deeper analysis.
- External factors like market or organizational changes are excluded.
